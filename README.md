ðŸŒ³ Decision Tree Classifier on Bank Marketing Dataset
ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project implements a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
It demonstrates end-to-end data handling â€” from extraction and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and visualization.

ðŸ§  Key Features

âœ… Automatically extracts nested ZIP files containing the dataset

âœ… Encodes categorical columns using LabelEncoder

âœ… Splits data into training and testing sets

âœ… Trains a Decision Tree Classifier

âœ… Evaluates model performance using accuracy and classification report

âœ… Visualizes the trained decision tree for better interpretability

ðŸ§© Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Google Colab
